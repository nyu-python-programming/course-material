## Getting help

### FAQ

Students are expected to consult the [Student Etiquette FAQ](etiquette.md) prior to asking questions of the tutors, professor, or other students. This allows us to focus our time on questions of greater significance.

### Slack

Our course uses Slack as its main communication channel for announcements and discussion. This is a good place to ask questions that anyone - other students, graders, tutors, or the professor - can answer.

- You are not required to supply any personally-identifiable information when signing up for Slack. Discuss with the professor if you have concerns or questions about privacy.
- **You must create your own _private_ channel in Slack** and invite our graders to join it - name this channel `assgn_fb1258`, where `fb1258` is replaced with your own NYU Net ID.

## Assignments

- all file names must follow standard [naming conventions](basic-computer-concepts.md#File_names).
  - No capital letters
  - No spaces
  - No special characters except the underscore `_` character and the dot `.` before the extension.
  - **We will not accept files that do not follow these rules.**

### Late penalty

- assignments are due before class on the due date indicated on the schedule
- for every 24 hours that an assignment is late, we will apply a 10% penalty on the grade, up to a maximum penalty of 30%.
- after 72 hours, we will no longer accept the assignment.

### Extensions

- You are automatically granted 2 late assignment extensions of up to 3 days late each, with the exception that all assignments must be submitted before the last day of regular classes before the final exam
- When submitting an assignment for which you would like to use one of these automatic extensions, you must notify the grader that you are using the extension, otherwise your assignment will be rejected.
- **Do not ask for any extensions from the professor or graders**
